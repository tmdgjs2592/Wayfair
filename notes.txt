Apache Flink vs Akka
- Akka
	- streamlines the process of building and running heavy-duty distributed apps.
	- creating a standalone application
- Apache Flink
	- it manages a cluster (Automatic distribution)
	- each incoming event affects the final results exactly once even in case o a machine or software failure.
	- uses Akka internally.

Flink vs Kafka
They both process data.
Kafka is an event buffer and Flink is a stream processing framework that can act on a buffer or any data source.
